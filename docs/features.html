            produce risk-adjusted returns far greater than those achieved by the average investor.

                    The intelligent investor, using common sense and without extraordinary financial
                    acumen,
                    can outperform the pros. In a world where financial markets are highly
                    efficient, there is
                    absolutely no reason that careful and disciplined novices — those who know the
                    rudiments
                    but lack the experience — cannot hold their own or even surpass the long-run
                    returns
                    earned by professional investors as a group. Successful investing involves doing
                    just a
                    few things right and avoiding serious mistakes.

                    There are an infinite number of strategies worse than this one: commit, over a
                    few years,
                    your money to a stock index fund. Ignore interim price fluctuations. Hold your
                    positions
                    for as long as you live, subject only to infrequent and marginal adjustments as
                    your
                    circumstances change.

                    It is not necessary to own many funds to achieve effective diversification. A
                    single
                    all-world stock index fund contains thousands of stocks, including all styles
                    and
                    cap-sizes.

                    A simple portfolio has many advantages. It almost always lowers costs (including taxes),
                    makes analysis easier, simplifies rebalancing, simplifies tax-preparation, reduces
                    paper-work and record-keeping, and enables caregivers and heirs to easily take over the
                    portfolio when necessary. Best of all, a simple portfolio allows you to spend more time
                    with family and friends, and less time managing your finances.

                    Time dramatically enhances capital accumulation as the magic of compounding

                    It pays to take reasonable risks in the search for higher long-term rates of
                    return. The
                    magic of compounding accelerates sharply with even modest increases in the
                    annual rate of
                    return. While an investment of €10 000 earning an annual return of +10% grows to
                    a value
                    of €108 000 over 25 years, at +12% the final value is €170 000. The difference
                    of €62 000

                    Rather than trying to pick specific stocks or sectors of the market that may
                    outperform in the future, we buy widely diversified all-world stock index funds
                    that
                    approximate the whole market. This guarantees we will receive the average return
                    of all

                    Being average sounds bad, but it is actually a great thing. That's because most
                    investors perform worse than average after taking into account the high fees
                    they pay for
                    actively managed funds. Studies of fund managers indicate that there is no
                    evidence
                    of persistent outperformance. Funds that outperform one year tend to
                    underperform in the
                    next. That means more than 94% of actively managed funds underperform index
                    funds over the
                    long run.

                    Never forget that risk, return, and cost are the three sides of the eternal
                    triangle of
                    investing. Remember also that the cost penalty may sharply erode the risk
                    premium to which
                    an investor is entitled. You should understand unequivocally that investing in a
                    fund with
                    a relatively high expense ratio — more than 1% — bears careful examination.
                    Unless you are
                    confident that the higher costs you incur are justified by higher expected
                    returns, select
                    your investments from among the lower-cost no-load funds.

                    Don’t ever buy an investment based on what it has done in the past. Every
                    investment you are looking to buy comes with a prospectus that tells you more
                    about the fund. And in each one, usually on one of the first pages, it states
                    that past fund performance is no guarantee of future returns. No matter what you
                    are investing in, eventually, the hot stock will one day not be the hot stock
                    any longer.
                    <br><br>
                    Another way to look at this is the law of gravity. What goes up, must come down.
                    Investments are the same. High-fliers will always come back down to earth. So
                    don’t invest your money into stocks that you think will never come down because
                    eventually, they will.

                    Once you establish a regular savings pattern, you can begin the process of
                    accumulating financial wealth. How much saving is enough? 20% of income is a
                    good baseline number. If you plan to retire before age 65 or plan to leave
                    significant assets to charity or children, you probably need to save even more.
                    The reason starting a regular savings plan early in life is important is that
                    the compounding of investment returns can be magnified over a longer period.
                    <br><br>
                    The best way to save money is to arrange automatic deductions from your
                    paycheck. This concept, described as "paying yourself first," goes a long way
                    towards establishing and reinforcing reasonable spending habits.

                    The best and lowest cost way to buy the whole stock market is with index funds
                    (through ETFs). By purchasing a single all-world stock index fund, an investor
                    owns a piece of essentially every public company in the world. This
                    diversification lowers risk because the failure of any one company does not have
                    a big effect. The investor is still exposed to the high volatility of the
                    overall stock market, but in exchange, the investor gets to participate in
                    whatever returns the market is generous enough to give over time.

                <div class="mb-5">
                    Markets are unpredictable. Costs are forever. The lower your costs, the greater
                    your share of an investment's return. And research suggests that lower-cost
                    investments have tended to outperform higher-cost alternatives.
                    <br><br>
                    The difference between an expense ratio of 0.5% and 1.5% might not seem like
                    much, but the effect of the compounding over an investing lifetime is enormous.
                    After 30 years, a fund with a 1.5% expense ratio will provide an investor with
                    several hundred thousand dollars less for retirement than a 0.5% index fund with
                    the same growth. And remember that most actively managed funds actually
                    underperform passive index funds. Costs matter and investors need returns
                    compounding for their own benefit, not the benefit of fund companies who skim
                    unnecessary fees off the top.
